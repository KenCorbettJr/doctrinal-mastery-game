I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was¬†seized¬†upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick¬†darkness¬†gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But, exerting all my powers to¬†call¬†upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into¬†despair¬†and abandon myself to destruction‚Äînot to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being‚Äîjust at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of¬†light¬†exactly over my head, above the brightness of the¬†sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself¬†delivered¬†from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I¬†saw¬†two¬†Personages, whose brightness and¬†glory¬†defy all description,¬†standing¬†above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other‚Äî*This is My¬†Beloved¬†Son. Hear Him! My object in going to¬†inquire¬†of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)‚Äîand which I should join. I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all¬†wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those¬†professors¬†were all¬†corrupt; that: ‚Äúthey¬†draw near¬†to me with their lips, but their¬†hearts¬†are far from me, they teach for doctrines the¬†commandments¬†of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the¬†power¬†thereof." He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself¬†lying¬†on my back, looking up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace,¬†mother¬†inquired what the matter was. I replied, ‚ÄúNever mind, all is well‚ÄîI am well enough off.‚Äù I then said to my mother, ‚ÄúI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.‚Äù It seems as though the¬†adversary¬†was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me?
