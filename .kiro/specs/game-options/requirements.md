# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds configurable game options to the Doctrinal Mastery Game that alter gameplay mechanics to provide variety and different difficulty levels. The primary focus is on implementing dynamic answer elimination where incorrect answers gradually disappear over time, making the correct answer more obvious as time progresses. This feature enhances the educational experience by providing adaptive difficulty and maintaining engagement through varied gameplay mechanics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game facilitator, I want to configure game options before starting a round, so that I can customize the gameplay experience for different skill levels and group dynamics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game setup screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Game Options" section with configurable settings
2. WHEN a user selects game options THEN the system SHALL persist these settings for the current game session
3. WHEN game options are configured THEN the system SHALL display a summary of active options during gameplay
4. IF no options are selected THEN the system SHALL use default gameplay mechanics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want incorrect answers to gradually disappear during a question, so that the difficulty decreases over time and I have a better chance of learning the correct answer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Answer Elimination" option is enabled AND a question is displayed THEN the system SHALL start a timer for answer elimination
2. WHEN the elimination timer reaches predefined intervals THEN the system SHALL randomly remove one incorrect answer from the display
3. WHEN an incorrect answer is eliminated THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth visual transition (fade out animation)
4. WHEN only the correct answer and one incorrect answer remain THEN the system SHALL stop the elimination process
5. IF a player selects an answer before elimination completes THEN the system SHALL stop the elimination timer immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game facilitator, I want to configure the timing and behavior of answer elimination, so that I can adjust the difficulty curve to match my group's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring answer elimination THEN the system SHALL provide options for elimination interval timing (e.g., every 3, 5, or 10 seconds)
2. WHEN configuring answer elimination THEN the system SHALL provide options for how many answers to eliminate (e.g., eliminate down to 2 choices, 3 choices, or all incorrect)
3. WHEN elimination settings are changed THEN the system SHALL validate that at least 2 answer choices will remain
4. WHEN invalid elimination settings are detected THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent game start

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual indicators showing which game options are active, so that I understand the current gameplay mechanics and can adjust my strategy accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game options are active THEN the system SHALL display option indicators in the game interface
2. WHEN answer elimination is active THEN the system SHALL show a countdown or progress indicator for the next elimination
3. WHEN an answer is about to be eliminated THEN the system SHALL provide a brief visual warning (e.g., slight highlight or pulse)
4. WHEN game options change between rounds THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game facilitator, I want to enable or disable game options mid-game, so that I can adapt the gameplay experience based on how players are performing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide access to game options through a settings menu
2. WHEN game options are changed mid-game THEN the system SHALL apply changes starting with the next question
3. WHEN options are disabled mid-game THEN the system SHALL complete any active elimination timers for the current question
4. WHEN options are enabled mid-game THEN the system SHALL start the new mechanics with the next question

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game options system to be extensible, so that additional game mechanics can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing game options THEN the system SHALL use a modular architecture that supports adding new option types
2. WHEN new game options are added THEN the system SHALL not require changes to core game logic components
3. WHEN game options are processed THEN the system SHALL use a consistent interface for all option types
4. WHEN game state is managed THEN the system SHALL separate option-specific state from core game state
